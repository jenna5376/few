                    Sparkmania arcade is an online arcade with three mini-games:
                    wack-a-mole, bread eater, and follow the leader. There are six
                    different selectable characters and you get a score based on your
                    performance every round.

                <p class="body-text">
                    ​We wanted to evoke feelings of nostalgia, excitement, slight
                    frustration, and fun with this game. As we were Nintendo fans growing up,
                    we wanted our arcade to have an old, retro-style aesthetic.
                    <br><br>
                    We started off by finding some game designs we liked and adding them to our mood board.

                <h3 class="h3">Game Ideas and Breakdown</h3>
                <p class="body-text">
                    We came up with some mini-game ideas. We originally wanted the characters
                    to be controllable by body movements as we thought it would make the game
                    more engaging for players. Unfortunately, this caused the games to be too
                    laggy for our devices, but this restriction helped us come up with ideas!

                    We chose the whack a mole, dodging, and follow the leader games. We ended
                    up replacing the doing game with the bread eater game, which has the same
                    logic but with different assets. In order to make the coding process easier,
                    we broke down the games into their logic, and how we may implement them through code.

                    We decided on anthropomorphic animals for the characters. We decided
                    to give these characters different personalities in order to make the
                    players more attached to them.

                <p class="body-text">
                    We user-tested our game with other students. The most common feedback
                    we got was that the game controls were difficult to memorize. In order
                    to solve this issue, we decided to add controls to the actual game rather
                    than just the tutorial page for a few seconds. This would give the users
                    time to familiarize themselves with the game.

                <p class="body-text">
                    This was my first large-scale coding project and it was really fun to be
                    able to create mini-games similar to what I played as a child. We did a
                    lot of sketching and ideating for the project, and I feel like this made the
                    actual coding and drawing process a lot easier, and gave the arcade a more
                    consistent style. We were able to add elements of interactivity to our project by
                    using a lot of sound effects, animated texts, and animated characters.
