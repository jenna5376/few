                <p class="body-text">
                    Bondit is a location-based social media app for US college students.
                    The app aims to promote bonding between college peers through features including
                    shareable course schedule, course group chat, map, friend discovery feed, and chat.
                    However, the app provided too many features, and the MAU, DAU, and user retention
                    remained low. In this study, we set out to understand gen-z trends for bonding to
                    make the product more useful and engaging for college students.

                <p class="body-text">
                    Bonding can be difficult and awkward for college students--especially
                    when they are stuck in large lecture halls (or a campusless school like NYU).
                    Bondit seeks to aid in this process. To achieve this, we aimed to find what
                    students find overwhelming or lacking about the current iteration of Bondit.
                    <span class="body-text-bold">
                        What do college students consider when forming new friendships, and how can
                        we use this information to increase Bondit’s user retention and acquisition?

                    We conducted competitive analysis on ten social media apps, specifically those targeting college
                    students,
                    to understand the role of Bondit within the greater app market.

                    Bondit may be used based on differing goals. Jennifer's key features were
                    map and chat while Raj's key features were course scheduling, chat, and
                    professor ratings.

                    profile, chat, and professor rating. Through this, we were able to find
                    a minor bug where friend's profiles did not appear in the profile tab when
                    filtered by peer.
